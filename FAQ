Frequently Asked Questions

Q: How do I configure openttsd in user-mode?

A: Run
        otts-conf
   and answer some basic questions

Q: During the instalation, when running `make' and `make install',
   I get some strange message from libtool and the process crashes:
    ../../libtool: s%^.*/%%: is not a file or directory
    ../../libtool: -e: command not found
    ../../libtool: -e: command not found
    (repeating several times)

A: Libtool uses `sed' as it's tool to modify text, but the new versions rely on
   the environment variable SED to contain the name of the command to call.
   This variable must be set when building programs using these versions of
   libtool.  You can run make like that (if you have `sed' in your PATH):

    $ SED=sed make
    $ su root
    $ SED=sed make install

   or
   
    $ export SED=sed
    $ make
    $ su root
    $ make install


Q: Flite has only a very crappy voice!

A: Flite is only a simple light software synthesizer and it's voices are not of
   a very high quality.  Festival can do much better and it also supports
   various languages.  But if you are compiling Flite and OpenTTS
   yourselves, there are still chances that you can improve the Flite voice
   considerably by using the 16-bit KAL voice instead of the (in the
   distribution tarball default) 8-bit voice.  To be able to use the 16-bit
   voice, you have to compile Flite with a special flag, please consult it's
   documentation or ./configure --help.  Then you should recompile OpenTTS
   (no flag is necessary, it will be automatically installed with
   the better voice).

   If you are using Debian or any other package based distribution, the 16-bit
   voice should be installed by default and there is no need for you to care
   about it.

Q: Festival doesn't speak. What can I do?

A: Are you sure you have installed festival-freebsoft-utils 0.3 or higher as
   described in the file INSTALL?

A: Are you sure you are not running into the famous 'server_access_list'
   problem?  Please see the file INSTALL.

Q: How can I install the ibmtts module on a 64-bit system?

A: Unfortunately, the IBMTTS library is only available in a 32-bit version.
Therefore, you need to build the module on a 32-bit system, perhaps
running in a virtual machine.
Once you have built it, you need to copy both the module and some audio
plugins to the 64-bit system.  Here is a step-by-step explanation of
what you must do on your 32-bit system to build the module.
Note that these directions assume that your prefix is /usr/local.
If you are using a different prefix, replace /usr/local with that prefix.

1. Configure as usual.
./configure --prefix=/usr/local
2. Run make, but override the audiodir variable.
make audiodir=/usr/local/lib/opentts/audio32
3. And make install, using the same override.
make install audiodir=/usr/local/lib/opentts/audio32
4. Copy /usr/local/lib/opentts/modules/ibmtts to the
/usr/local/lib/opentts/modules/ibmtts on the 64-bit system.
5. Copy the whole /usr/local/lib/opentts/audio32 tree to
/usr/local/lib/opentts/audio32 on the 64-bit system.

Now, your 32-bit ibmtts module will look for the 32-bit audio plugins
that it needs in /usr/local/lib/opentts/audio32.
