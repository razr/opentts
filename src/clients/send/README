This is a simple command line client to  openttsd.  It may be useful in
programs, which don't want to use direct socket communication with openttsd for some reason.

To compile the program, just run `make'.  To install it, run `make install'.

The following operations are supported:

$ otts-send --open HOST PORT

  Open new connection to openttsd running at HOST:PORT and print the
  connection identifier on the standard output.

$ otts-send --close CONNECTION

  Close the given openttsd CONNECTION.

$ otts-send --send CONNECTION

  Read an SSIP command from standard input, forward it to openttsd over the connection
  CONNECTION and print the answer on the standard output.
